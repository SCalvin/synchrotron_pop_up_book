Synchrotron Pop-Up Book
=======================

A note on the format of this document:

 * The script is divided into 4 sections, one each for the front and
   back covers and one for each of the two spreads
 * Subsections describe specific pop-up components
 * (Text in parentheses) indicates comments about the text
 * {Text in brackets} indicates instructions about the placement of text
 * All other text is the actual content of the book.

First spread: Storage ring
--------------------------


## Overview

{Upper left corner}

 * Facility operates 24/7
 * when fully built out, facility will support around 60 beamlines
   operating simultaneously
 * will support over 4000 visitors each year from around the USA and
   the world, and from academia, government, and industry
 * will support experiments in chemistry and energy science, life
   science, materials science, earth and environmental science --
   virtually every issue of societal and economic interest with a
   scientific component will be explored at NSLS-II

## Electron path

{This text is intended to follow a path on the page.  The infield of
the ring will depict, slightly above scale, the linac and booster
ring.  The path of text will wend its way down the linac, around the
booster, and into the storage ring.}

Electrons are produced in bunches by striking a diamond anode with a
powerful laser.  The electron bunches gain energy as they travel down
the linear accelerator and are injected into the booster ring.  In the
booster the bunches are raised in energy to 3 GeV energy and injected
into the storage ring.

## Bend magnet

The storage ring is a 30-sided polygon.  Bend magnets at each corner
steer the electron beam bewteen straight sections and generate X-ray
beams for experiments.  *Something something about charged particles
and magnets.*

## Undulator

An undulator is an array of dozens of powerful magnets.  Each pair of
magnets generates X-rays by *the same something something*.  The
careful arrangement of the magnets allows for constructive
interference between the light from each pair, resulting in a massive
amplification of the intensity at specific energies.  The energy
response of the undulator is tuned by adjusting the size of the gap
between the magnet arrays.

(Other properties of the undulator: large coherence fraction , small
source size, small divergence, high brightness, high brilliance.  All
important stuff, but perhaps beyond the scope of the book.)

Second spread: Beamline
-----------------------


## First optical enclosure

This small room contains the instrumentation used to process the white
light generated by the storage ring so that it can be used for the
particular experiment at a beamline.  While each kind of experiment
has special requirements and may have a differnt compliment of optics,
the generic FOE shown here explains the function of the most common
optical devices.  The *collimating mirror* removes divergence from the
beam such that all rays exiting the mirror are parallel.  The *mono
chromator* filters the light, allowing only the energy required for
the experiment to continnue down the beam path.  The *focussing
mirror* fucusses the X-ray beam onto a small spot in the experimental
end station.

(White light -- and other terms -- too jargony!)

## Monochromator

The monochromator filters the light generated by the source, selecting
just the energy required by the experiment.  For hard X-ray beamlines,
energy selection is typically made using very pure silicon crystals.
*Something about diffraction and wavelength.* By changing the angle of
incience of the incoming X-ray beam, different energies are selected
for the experiment. The second crystal redirects the beam towards the
end station.  

(Need to have explained that bends and undulators are examples of
sources.)

(Some other things that may be worth mentioning: (1) soft X-ray
beamlines use grating (2) a scattering beamlines may have fixed a mono
(3) other materials)

## Experiments

(Each experiment requires text for the instrumentation objects and for
the presentation of results)

### Macromolecular crystallography

###### Instrumentation

Blah blah

###### Experiment

Potassium ion channel, Nobel prize for work in part at NSLS

### Fluorescence imaging

###### Instrumentation

Blah blah

###### Experiment

Whole leaf, Co hyperaccumulation and distribution, star-shaped nodules
of silicate as an anti-herbivory strategy

Light enters KB mirrors, focused to a very small spot -- in this case
about 20 microns.  High energy, emission from all transition metals,
raster, signal from each metal depends upon amount at that spot.  In
that way, the distribution of metals around the leaf can be measured.

One beamline at NSLS-II will perform this experiment with a 10 nm
spot!

### X-rays Absorption Spectroscopy

Instrumentation 
: Blah blah

###### Experiment

(Let Scott take the first whackhere.)
