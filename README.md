Synchrotron Pop-Up Book
=======================

The source materials and building instructions for a pop-up book about
the NSLS-II synchtotron.

 * **Designed by:** Linnea Russell (Sarah Lawrence College)
 * **Written by:** Scott Calvin (Sarah Lawrence College) and Bruce
   Ravel (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
 * **Produced by:** The Photon Sciences Users' Executive Committee at
   Brookhaven National Laboratory

This repository will eventually contain the script and image sources
(likely in the form of Adobe Illustrator save files, possibly also
PDF, SVG, and others) for the book.  The intent is that the images can
be printed in full color and two-sided.  The repository will contain
instructions (likely in the form of a markdown file, perhaps with
images further explaining the construction details) for assembling a
copy of the pop-up book.
